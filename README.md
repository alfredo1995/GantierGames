* The game HUD must have the name of the white pawn player in the right corner and the black pawn player in the left corner, both at the bottom;

* Between the players' names there will be a button, which the player whose turn it is to play must click so that a number from 0 to 2 is drawn, this number will be the number of cells that the pawn can move;

* In the central part of the HUD at the top there should be the number of matches that each player has won;
